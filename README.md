The Workdiary app is a digital platform designed specifically for teachers to streamline the process of recording, tracking, and managing their daily academic activities. Unlike traditional paper-based diaries, this app offers a centralized and user-friendly interface where teachers can log in securely using their institutional credentials, view their personalized timetable, and document the topics covered in each class session. The app also allows teachers to update the status of work completed, ensuring that all instructional progress is accurately recorded and easily accessible for future reference.



A key feature of the Workdiary app is its automated reminder system, which sends SMS notifications to teachers 15 minutes prior to each scheduled class, based on their timetable. This proactive approach helps teachers stay organized and punctual, reducing the risk of missed sessions or incomplete lesson coverage. Additionally, the app provides editing capabilities, enabling teachers to modify entries, update work statuses, and manage their schedules efficiently. All data is securely stored on a cloud backend (such as Back4App), ensuring accessibility, reliability, and data integrity.



By digitizing the work diary process, the app not only saves time and effort but also enhances accountability and transparency within the educational environment. Teachers benefit from features such as easy retrieval of past records, timely reminders, and the ability to generate summaries for meetings or reviews. Ultimately, the Workdiary app supports teachers in maintaining comprehensive records of their instructional activities, fostering a more organized and effective teaching experience.
